### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Margaret Sabelhaus & I love all things data. Hopefully my profile can provide you some insight into what sort of projects I'm interested in. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, statistics, & environmental policy.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects for my Advanced Machine Learning course (& various fun Kaggle competitions).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently obtaining a Master's in Data Science at Colorado School of Mines.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: margaret.sabelhaus@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Art is a big part of my life and I love to paint when there's time for it. I think that's why I like Data Science so much--there's plenty of room for creativity in answering data-driven questions :)
