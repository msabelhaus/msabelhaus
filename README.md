### Hello! ğŸ‘‹

My name is Margaret Sabelhaus & I love all things data.

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in machine learning, predictive modeling, and finding trends in big data.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an image recognition project for my Advanced Machine Learning course (& various fun Kaggle competitions).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently obtaining a Master's in Data Science at Colorado School of Mines.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: margaret.sabelhaus@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Art is a big part of my life and I love to paint when there's time for it. I think that's why I like Data Science so much--there's plenty of room for creativity in answering data-driven questions :)
